# g is the key, it must cascade through several conditions in order to increment h.

# outer loop on 29 must run (126300 - 109300) / 17 = 1000 times, h will only be incremented if f == 0 at this point.
# f will only == 0 if d * e == b at some point during that iteration

# loop on 19 increments e every time and will not reset until the loop completes. This loop must run b-2 times until e == b

# d only increments every time e == b
# d is only reset after the outer loop cycles, e is reset every time d == b

# b increments by an odd number, therefore every 2 outer iterations, when d is even f cannot increment
# this means I must determine for which d * e combos b can be reached. Both e and d will increment through all values up until b
# if they miss it, a reset must occur

# d starts at 2, this means every time b is even, f will always increment at some point. It's the odd b's that take thinking about.
# There is some factorization that may help since d and e must be factors of b
# Since we increment through all combinations of d and e, this should mean than any non-prime b will result in h being incremented
# If this is true, we just need to find the number of primes and then do 1000 - n_primes = h
# There are 90 primes. Also I think the total number of times h would be incremented is 1001 because the range (109300, 126300) is inclusive
